## ðŸš€ **How to Use**

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and all necessary libraries installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Train the Model Locally**:
   Add non-malware files to the `training_files/0` folder and malware-related files to the `training_files/amas_reports`. Lunaris will automatically train the model if new files are detected.

3. **Run Lunaris**:
   Start Lunaris and follow the terminal prompts to sync pre-trained models or train locally.
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web Interface**:
   You can access the web interface by visiting:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
